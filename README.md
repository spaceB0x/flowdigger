# flowdigger

flowdigger is a software netflow generator that utilizes the python 'scapy' library to create netflow data to send to a central collector. Hopefully aiding in security analytics and incident response. Since it it based in python it should hopefully be cross platform. It requires the third-party scapy module which can be found here https://github.com/spaceB0x/netflow-in-scapy. Which of course requires Scapy in the first place.
